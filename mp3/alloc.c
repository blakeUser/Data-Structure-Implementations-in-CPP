 * up to the lesser of the new and old sizes, even if the block is moved. If
 * the new size is larger, the value of the newly allocated portion is
 * indeterminate.

 * a new block of size bytes and returning a pointer to the beginning of it.
 *
 * In case that the size is 0, the memory previously allocated in ptr is
 * deallocated as if a call to free was made, and a NULL pointer is returned.
 *
 * @param ptr
 *    Pointer to a memory block previously allocated with malloc(), calloc()
 *    or realloc() to be reallocated.
 *
 *    If this is NULL, a new block is allocated and a pointer to it is
 *    returned by the function.
 *
 * @param size
 *    New size for the memory block, in bytes.

 *    If it is 0 and ptr points to an existing block of memory, the memory
 *    block pointed by ptr is deallocated and a NULL pointer is returned.
 *
 * @return
 *    A pointer to the reallocated memory block, which may be either the
 *    same as the ptr argument or a new location.
 *
 *    The type of this pointer is void*, which can be cast to the desired
 *    type of data pointer in order to be dereferenceable.
 *
 *    If the function failed to allocate the requested block of memory,
 *    a NULL pointer is returned, and the memory block pointed to by
 *    argument ptr is left unchanged.
