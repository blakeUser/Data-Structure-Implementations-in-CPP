# Data-Structure-Implementations-in-CPP
This repository stores several cool projects about data structures. 
1) In the Maze Solver Project, you can use the code to generate a random maze and solve it. The size of the maze is up to you. The code can also draw the maze and solution for you. In terms of data structure, a disjoint set is used to represent each square of the uninitialized maze, and the set reorganization realized by up-trees.
2) In the Giant Mosaic project, based on the picture you upload, the code can generate a giant mosiac picture constructed by the pictures stored in the data directory. The idea behind the scene is to use the kd-tree to find the picture that has the most similar regional pixel compared with the pixel block of the picture you upload. 
3) In the PNG traversal machine, the machine can traverse through the PNG file you upload. You can choose either BFS and DFS to traverse. While you traverse though the PNG file, you can do whatever you want to those pixels in the PNG file. The idea behind the scene is to use stack for implementing DFS and queue for implementing BFS.
